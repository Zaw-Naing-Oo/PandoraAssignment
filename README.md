Frontend React
Backend Nodejs Express Mysql

You need to install package  first in each frontend and backend folder of main folder using command "npm install".
Set up .env file both frontend and backend.
I used PORT 8000 in backend, but you can change whatever port you like.
You need to set up mysql and create database. and then set up username, password and database in database.js.
I used last version of mysql and mysql Workbench for GUI tools.
